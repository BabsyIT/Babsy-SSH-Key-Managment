# Ansible Lint Configuration for Babsy SSH Key Management
#
# This config file suppresses certain warnings that are either:
# - Difficult to fix without major refactoring (var-naming)
# - Acceptable in our use case (run-once, name[template])
# - Legacy code patterns that work fine (ignore-errors in specific cases)

---
# Exclude certain directories from linting
exclude_paths:
  - .cache/
  - test/
  - collections/

# Skip specific rules
skip_list:
  - var-naming[no-role-prefix]  # Would require refactoring all variable references
  - name[template]               # Jinja in task names is acceptable for dynamic naming
  - run-once[task]               # Used intentionally for single-execution tasks
  - ignore-errors                # Used carefully with proper error handling
  - yaml[line-length]            # Some lines are legitimately long

# Warn only (don't fail) on these rules
warn_list:
  - experimental

# Enable offline mode (don't check for updates)
offline: true

# Profile to use
profile: production
